          <h5>Conservation Areas: Celebrating 50 years</h5>
          <p>
            Conservation Areas were established 50 years ago in 1967 by the
            Civic Amenities Act and the Bloomsbury Conservation Area Advisory

            in the west to King's Cross Road in the east. The Bloomsbury
            Conservation Area was one of the first to be designated after
